<h1 align="center"> My personal repository of university education </h1>

Hi, I study at St. Petersburg State University in the MM-23.B09 (Ð‘09) group. And I will post some of my homework and other work here.

If you ask me, why?

It's simple.

1) If I save my works to GitHub, I will never lose them and I will never forget them anywhere.
2) It can also be useful for those who have problems with some homework or other work

I advise everyone who is studying to be an IT specialist to keep their repository in github.
